## Description
#### This project analyzes how different set variables influence the happiness of citizens in countries across the world. With numbers representing how much each variable plays into one's happiness, we can analyze what reasons may influence those variables. Why and how do those variables affect happiness. With these datasets from the 2022 World Happiness Report, we are able to dive into different visualizations and data analyses that reveal answers to our questions.

### Research Questions
#### How does the happiness score vary between the United States and the top ranked country for happiness, Finland?
#### Which variables have major differences and what might be the cause of them?
