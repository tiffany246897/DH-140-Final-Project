## Description
#### This project analyzes how different set variables influence the happiness of citizens in countries across the world. With numbers representing how much each variable plays into one's happiness, we can analyze what reasons may influence those variables. Why and how do those variables affect happiness. With these datasets from the 2022 World Happiness Report, we are able to dive into different visualizations and data analyses that reveal answers to our questions.

### Research Questions
#### Which variable plays the largest factor in the happiness of each country?
#### Does that variable have any correlation with other vairables? What examples can we use to support these relationships?
